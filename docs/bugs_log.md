# Bugs Encountered During URL-to-Transcript Development Session

## Environment
- **OS:** Windows 11 (WSL2)
- **Python:** 3.12.10 in virtual environment
- **GPU:** RTX 4080 Laptop GPU (12GB VRAM)
- **Date:** July 14, 2025

## Bug #1: CUDA Version Mismatch
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Symptoms:**
```
RuntimeError: Library cublas64_12.dll is not found or cannot be loaded
```

**Root Cause:** 
- System had CUDA 11.8 installed 
- WhisperX/CTranslate2 4.0.0+ requires CUDA 12.x libraries
- PyTorch was compiled for cu118 but WhisperX needed cu124

**Resolution:**
- Upgraded CUDA toolkit from 11.8 to 12.9
- Reinstalled PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 support:
  ```bash
  pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
  ```

## Bug #2: WhisperX API Changes  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Symptoms:**
```
AttributeError: 'FasterWhisperPipeline' object has no attribute 'processor'
TypeError: align() got an unexpected keyword argument 'batch_size'
```

**Root Cause:**
- WhisperX API changed between versions
- `processor` attribute renamed to `tokenizer`
- `align()` function signature changed

**Resolution:**
Updated API calls in `src/core/whisperx_engine.py`:
```python
# Old (broken):
whisper_result = whisperx.align(whisper_result["segments"],
                                self.model.model, self.model.processor,
                                audio_path, self.device, self.dtype,
                                batch_size=16)

# New (working):
alignment_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code="en", device=self.device)
whisper_result = whisperx.align(whisper_result["segments"],
                                alignment_model, metadata,
                                audio_path, self.device)
```

## Bug #3: FFmpeg Subprocess Hanging
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Symptoms:**
- yt-dlp downloads complete (shows 100%) but process hangs indefinitely
- Audio conversion using FFmpeg post-processors never completes
- Process hangs at `[download] 100% of X.XXMiB in 00:00:XX at X.XXMiB/s`

**Root Cause:**
- Windows-specific subprocess deadlock with FFmpeg post-processing
- yt-dlp's FFmpeg integration has known issues on Windows
- Related to subprocess pipe handling and console window management

**Resolution:**
Replaced FFmpeg post-processing with subprocess approach:
```python
# Old (hangs):
ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'postprocessors': [{
        'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
        'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
        'preferredquality': '192',
    }],
    # ...
}

# New (works):
cmd = [
    sys.executable, '-m', 'yt_dlp',
    '--format', 'bestaudio',
    '--output', base_path + '.%(ext)s', 
    '--print-json',
    '--quiet',
    url
]
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=300)
```

## Bug #4: faulthandler Timeout Interference
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Symptoms:**
```
Timeout (0:00:30)!
Thread 0x000014bc (most recent call first):
[stack trace output every 30 seconds]
```

**Root Cause:**
- `faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(30, repeat=True)` was triggering during model downloads
- Caused premature process termination due to timeout detection

**Resolution:**
Disabled periodic faulthandler dumps:
```python
# Old (problematic):
faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(30, repeat=True)

# New (fixed):
# faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(30, repeat=True)   # disabled - causes timeouts during model downloads
```

## Bug #5: Windows Temp Directory Path Issues
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED

**Symptoms:**
- WhisperX transcription hangs when processing files from Windows temp directories
- Works fine with files in current directory
- Hangs at `DEBUG: Starting WhisperX transcription of: C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp_xyz.webm`

**Root Cause:**
- Windows temp directory paths may have permission/access issues
- Long path names or special characters causing problems
- Possible Unicode/encoding issues with temp file paths

**Attempted Resolution:**
Copy temp files to current directory before processing:
```python
# Copy temp file to current directory to avoid Windows temp path issues
import shutil
local_audio = "downloaded_audio.webm"
shutil.copy2(temp_audio, local_audio)
temp_audio = local_audio
```

**Status:** Testing in progress

## Bug #6: CLI vs Standalone Execution Context Differences
**Status:** ⚠️ UNDER INVESTIGATION

**Symptoms:**
- Standalone test scripts work perfectly
- CLI script hangs at various points (download, transcription)
- Same code, different execution results

**Root Cause:**
- Unknown execution environment differences
- Possible import path or module loading issues
- Threading or process context variations

**Workaround:**
Created separate `working_cli.py` that bypasses problematic patterns from main CLI.

## Bug #7: Missing cuDNN DLL Warnings
**Status:** ⚠️ COSMETIC ISSUE

**Symptoms:**
```
Could not locate cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll. Please make sure it is in your library path!
```

**Root Cause:**
- cuDNN path not properly configured
- DLL directory additions not taking effect

**Status:** 
- Doesn't prevent functionality
- System falls back gracefully
- Low priority cosmetic issue

## Bug #8: Model Version Compatibility Warnings
**Status:** ⚠️ COSMETIC ISSUE

**Symptoms:**
```
Model was trained with pyannote.audio 0.0.1, yours is 3.3.2. Bad things might happen unless you revert pyannote.audio to 0.x.
Model was trained with torch 1.10.0+cu102, yours is 2.6.0+cu124. Bad things might happen unless you revert torch to 1.x.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Version mismatches between model training environment and runtime
- Legacy models not updated for newer library versions

**Status:**
- Models still function correctly despite warnings
- No functional impact observed
- Low priority cosmetic issue

## Bug #9: WhisperX Diarization Rapid Speaker Change Accuracy
**Status:** ⚠️ IN PROGRESS

**Symptoms:**
- Diarization works but lumps rapid back-and-forth dialogue into single speaker blocks
- Opening dialogue shows massive text block attributed to one speaker containing multiple speaker exchanges
- Short utterances like "oh, really?", "what?", "no" incorrectly grouped with longer segments

**Root Cause Analysis:** 
- **Segmentation granularity mismatch**: WhisperX DiarizationPipeline creates coarser segments (designed for longer utterances)
- **VAD parameters**: Default voice activity detection window size too large for rapid speaker changes
- **Alignment issues**: Whisper transcription segments don't align with diarization speaker boundaries
- **Short utterance detection**: Pyannote struggles with utterances under 0.5-1 seconds

**Technical Analysis:**
- WhisperX `DiarizationPipeline` is high-level wrapper around `pyannote.audio` pipeline
- Doesn't expose crucial underlying hyperparameters for fine-grained detection
- Need to tune segmentation (VAD) parameters: minimum speech/non-speech duration
- Pyannote creates 126 segments for 30min audio vs needed finer granularity for rapid changes

**Resolution Attempts:**
1. ✅ Fixed basic diarization functionality and API integration
2. ✅ Added speaker name mapping and diarization method reporting
3. ✅ Confirmed issue is accuracy, not functionality
4. ❌ Default DiarizationPipeline parameters inadequate for rapid speaker changes
5. ❌ Custom fine-grained diarization method failed - fell back to standard method

**Latest Test Results:**
- Output shows "Diarization: WhisperX DiarizationPipeline" (not "Custom Fine-Grained Pipeline")
- Transcript identical to previous version - massive opening block remains
- Line 9 still contains rapid dialogue exchanges lumped under single speaker
- Custom VAD parameter tuning attempt unsuccessful

**Current Status:**
- Custom fine-grained method fails during execution
- Falls back to standard WhisperX DiarizationPipeline
- Need to debug why custom pyannote parameter modification fails
- May need alternative approach: post-processing or different model configuration
